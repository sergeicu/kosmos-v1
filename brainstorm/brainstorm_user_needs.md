# User Needs - Kosmos RCT Testing

## Primary Goal
Validate Kosmos's utility for computational biology research proposal generation in a controlled 2-hour pilot.

## User Persona
**Early-career computational biologists** participating in Schmidt Sciences RCT who need to:
- Generate novel research proposals quickly
- Conduct comprehensive literature reviews
- Analyze complex biological datasets
- Validate hypothesis novelty
- Design experiments with chemical/molecular components

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Speed
- Complete proposal-relevant tasks in minutes, not days
- Enable 2-week proposal timeline (grant requirement)

### 2. Accuracy
- Zero fabricated citations (deal-breaker)
- Scientifically valid hypotheses
- Chemically feasible molecular designs

### 3. Actionability
- Direct integration into grant proposals
- No additional verification burden
- Publication-ready figures/analyses

### 4. Coverage
- Span diverse comp bio domains (cancer, immunology, systems bio, structural bio, neuro)
- Handle different task types (literature, data, precedent, chemistry)

## Pain Points to Solve
1. **Literature overload:** 1000s of papers, need synthesis not search
2. **Novelty uncertainty:** Is this idea already done?
3. **Data analysis bottleneck:** Complex omics datasets require specialized skills
4. **Chemistry knowledge gap:** Biologists lack cheminformatics expertise

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Full experimental execution
- Wet lab protocol generation
- Long-term project management
- Multi-investigator collaboration features
