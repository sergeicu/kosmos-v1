These converge on neuroinflammation and \u03b1\u2011synuclein spread, with pharmacomicrobiomic modulation of levodopa adding a clinically actionable node (chandra2023gutmucosalcells pages 7-10, wang2021theroleof pages 17-18, modasia2022regulationofenteroendocrine pages 76-79, gallop2021theroleof pages 2-3).\n- Near\u2011term, the most actionable and safe strategies are diet/fiber/prebiotics/probiotics and targeted management of SIBO/H. pylori to optimize both circuit health and pharmacotherapy.
