### Task 2: Immunology ❌ FAIL
- **Capability**: PRECEDENT
- **Query**: mRNA cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens
- **Status**: Limited trial identification
- **Recall Rate**: 33% (found mRNA-4157, missed others)

### Task 3: Systems Biology ✅ PASS
- **Capability**: ANALYSIS
- **Query**: Spatial transcriptomics in tumor microenvironment
- **Status**: All success criteria met
- **Performance**: Comprehensive analysis with multi-omics integration

### Task 4: Structural Biology ✅ PASS
- **Capability**: MOLECULES
- **Query**: SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor design
- **Status**: All success criteria met
- **Performance**: Generated 3 valid molecules with improved properties

## Capability Assessment

| Capability | Task | Result | Strengths | Limitations |
|------------|------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| LITERATURE | Cancer Genomics | ❌ FAIL | Good mechanistic explanations | Poor trial recall |
| PRECEDENT | Immunology | ❌ FAIL | Identified key products | Missed most trials |
| ANALYSIS | Systems Biology | ✅ PASS | Excellent integration | Limited training data |
| MOLECULES | Structural Biology | ✅ PASS | Valid molecular designs | No binding affinity prediction |

## Key Findings

### Successful Capabilities
1. **MOLECULES**: Demonstrated strong computational drug design capability
   - Generated chemically valid structures
   - Improved key properties (solubility 300-5000×)
   - Provided synthetic routes

2. **ANALYSIS**: Showed sophisticated data interpretation
   - Multi-omics integration
   - Hypothesis generation
   - Clinical correlation

### Areas for Improvement
1. **LITERATURE/PRECEDENT**: Limited recall of specific trials
   - Need better clinical trial database integration
   - Improve NCT ID identification
   - Enhanced product/trade name recognition

2. **General**: Response format consistency
   - Varying status codes ("completed" vs "success")
   - Different result field locations
   - Need standardized API contracts

## Recommendations for Grant Applications

### Strengths to Highlight
1. **Drug Discovery Pipeline**: MOLECULES capability enables rapid hit-to-lead optimization
2. **Data Integration**: ANALYSIS capability supports complex multi-omics interpretation
3. **Speed**: All tasks completed in 15-37 minutes
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: $200 per comprehensive analysis

### Limitations to Address
1. **Clinical Trial Awareness**: Manual verification still required for clinical references
2. **Binding Affinity Prediction**: MOLECULES doesn't predict actual binding affinities
3. **Training Data**: Some capabilities show limited knowledge of very recent developments

## Files Generated by Task
- **Task 1**: `output/task1_results/`
- **Task 2**: `output/task2_results/`
- **Task 3**: `output/task3_results/`
- **Task 4**: `output/task4_results/`

Each task directory contains:
- Executive summary
- Detailed analysis
- Raw API outputs
- Evaluation metrics

## Conclusion
The Kosmos pilot study demonstrates mixed but promising results. While LITERATURE and PRECEDENT capabilities need improvement for clinical trial recall, ANALYSIS and MOLECULES show strong potential for research applications. The platform is valuable for:
- Early-stage drug discovery
- Multi-omics data interpretation
- Hypothesis generation
- Educational applications
