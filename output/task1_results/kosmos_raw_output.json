WEE1 inhibition synergizes with KRAS/MAPK blockade in preclinical models (khan2025druggingtheundruggablekrasa pages 15-17, shenoy2025recentadvancesand pages 13-15) | WEE1 or ATR inhibitors combined with KRAS inhibitors or DNA-damaging agents to exploit replication stress and synthetic lethality (khan2025druggingtheundruggablekrasa pages 15-17, shenoy2025recentadvancesand pages 13-15) | Activation of compensatory DDR pathways and checkpoint redundancy can limit durability;

EGFR/HER inhibitors (afatinib, others) | MAPK or KRAS inhibition upregulates HER2/ERBB signaling in PDAC models; combining MAPK/KRAS inhibitors with HER2-directed agents yields sustained regressions preclinically (adamopoulos2024inhibitionofthe pages 7-9, wei2024asmallmolecule pages 12-13) | KRAS/MAPK inhibitor + HER2/ERBB blockade (including ADCs) to prevent RTK-driven bypass and achieve deeper responses (adamopoulos2024inhibitionofthe pages 7-9) | Adaptive upregulation of alternate RTKs or downstream signaling nodes;

PI3K co-inhibition enhances KRAS inhibitor activity in preclinical models and may block a common bypass (wei2024asmallmolecule pages 12-13, wei2024asmallmolecule pages 8-9) | KRAS inhibitor + PI3K inhibitor to suppress parallel PI3K/AKT-driven escape and deepen MAPK pathway suppression (wei2024asmallmolecule pages 12-13) | PTEN loss or activation of downstream effectors (AKT/mTOR) and heterogeneous tumor subclones can mediate resistance (khan2025druggingtheundruggablekrasa pages 12-13, wei2024asmallmolecule pages 12-13) |\\n\\n\\n*Table: Concise table of the highest-priority, targetable dependencies in KRAS\u2011mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (2022\u20132025) showing representative agents, key supporting evidence, rational combination strategies, and the main resistance mechanisms reported in recent preclinical and early clinical literature.*\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.
