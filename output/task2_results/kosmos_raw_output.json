  "query": "Has anyone developed mRNA vaccines targeting solid tumor neoantigens\nusing patient-specific mutation profiles, and what were the clinical trial outcomes?",
  "answer": "Yes. Multiple groups have developed individualized mRNA vaccines that encode patient-specific neoantigens derived from each tumor\u2019s mutation profile, and these have reported clinical outcomes in solid tumors.\n\nMelanoma (adjuvant, resected high-risk disease)\n- Product and regimen: mRNA-4157 (V940; Moderna/Merck), an individualized poly\u2011neoantigen mRNA vaccine, administered intramuscularly with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab alone in the randomized, open-label phase 2b KEYNOTE\u2011942 trial after complete resection of stage IIIB\u2013IV melanoma.\n- Efficacy: The combination improved recurrence\u2011free survival (RFS). In the primary readout, HR for recurrence or death was approximately 0.56; 18\u2011month RFS 79% with mRNA\u20114157+pembrolizumab versus 62% with pembrolizumab alone. Subsequent summaries reported consistent or greater effect sizes and improved distant metastasis\u2011free survival (DMFS), with numerically higher overall survival (OS) rates on the combination at later follow\u2011up (trial still maturing) (weber2024individualisedneoantigentherapy pages 1-2, pelosi2024brafmutantmelanomasbiology pages 13-15).\n- Safety: Most adverse events were grade 1\u20132. Grade \u22653 treatment\u2011related AEs occurred in 25% with combination versus 18% with pembrolizumab alone; no vaccine\u2011related grade 4\u20135 events were reported (weber2024individualisedneoantigentherapy pages 1-2). Mechanistic reports summarized that mRNA\u20114157 induces robust neoantigen\u2011specific T\u2011cell responses (pelosi2024brafmutantmelanomasbiology pages 13-15).\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; adjuvant after resection)\n- Product and regimen: Autogene cevumeran (BNT122/RO7198457; BioNTech/Genentech), an individualized uridine mRNA\u2013lipoplex vaccine encoding up to 20 patient\u2011specific neoantigens, given sequentially with atezolizumab, then mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy, in a phase I, single\u2011arm adjuvant study of resected PDAC.\n- Immunogenicity: 8/16 (50%) vaccinated patients mounted de novo, high\u2011magnitude neoantigen\u2011specific T\u2011cell responses by stringent assays. Vaccine\u2011expanded T\u2011cell clones could comprise up to ~10% of circulating T cells, re\u2011expand after boosting, and exhibited polyfunctional effector CD8+ phenotypes (rojas2023personalizedrnaneoantigen pages 1-2, rojas2023personalizedrnaneoantigen pages 2-3).\n- Efficacy signal: At 18\u2011month median follow\u2011up, vaccine responders had longer RFS (not reached) than non\u2011responders (13.4 months; P=0.003), indicating a correlation between vaccine\u2011induced T cells and delayed recurrence (rojas2023personalizedrnaneoantigen pages 1-2). \n- Safety/feasibility: Manufacturing and on\u2011time delivery were feasible; treatment was generally tolerable (mostly grade 1\u20132 AEs). One patient experienced grade 3 fever and hypertension; no vaccine\u2011related grade \u22654 toxicities were reported (rojas2023personalizedrnaneoantigen pages 2-3).\n\nMulti\u2011tumor, early\u2011phase experience with the same platform (RO7198457/BNT122)\n- In a phase I program across solid tumors, peripheral blood neoantigen\u2011specific T\u2011cell responses were detected in approximately 77% of patients, with manageable reactogenicity (e.g., influenza\u2011like symptoms, infusion reactions). Early activity signals included modest objective response rates (e.g., ~10% urothelial, 22% renal cell, 30% melanoma, 4% triple\u2011negative breast, 10% NSCLC) when combined with checkpoint blockade in selected cohorts; these studies were not powered for definitive efficacy (huang2024mrnavaccinesas pages 11-11, galant2024mrnavaccinesin pages 5-6).\n\nRelated but not fully individualized effort\n- A mutation\u2011specific (not personalized per patient) KRAS G12V mRNA vaccine combined with pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors expanded mutation\u2011specific T cells and produced tumor shrinkage in two end\u2011stage patients, supporting the broader principle that mRNA immunization can drive clinically relevant responses; however, this approach targets a shared mutation rather than each patient\u2019s unique neoantigen repertoire (wang2024combinationtherapyof pages 1-2).\n\nConclusion\n- Individualized, patient\u2011specific mRNA neoantigen vaccines have been developed for solid tumors. The most mature evidence is in resected melanoma, where mRNA\u20114157 plus pembrolizumab improved RFS versus pembrolizumab alone with acceptable safety. In resected PDAC, autogene cevumeran generated substantial de novo T\u2011cell responses and an RFS correlation in responders, with good tolerability; randomized efficacy trials are ongoing or planned. Early multi\u2011tumor data with the same platform show high immunogenicity and manageable safety, with preliminary activity signals in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (weber2024individualisedneoantigentherapy pages 1-2, pelosi2024brafmutantmelanomasbiology pages 13-15, rojas2023personalizedrnaneoantigen pages 1-2, rojas2023personalizedrnaneoantigen pages 2-3, huang2024mrnavaccinesas pages 11-11, galant2024mrnavaccinesin pages 5-6, wang2024combinationtherapyof pages 1-2).",
