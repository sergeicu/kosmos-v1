# Task 2: Immunology - Executive Summary

## Task 2: Immunology - Execution Complete ✅

### Summary
Successfully executed Task 2 of the Kosmos pilot study, testing the PRECEDENT capability for identifying prior work on mRNA cancer vaccines.

### Key Results:
- **Kosmos Query**: "Has anyone developed mRNA vaccines targeting solid tumor neoantigens using patient-specific mutation profiles, and what were the clinical trial outcomes?"
- **Task ID**: 9e573c63-aa7d-4f79-adc3-501ffc4ba279
- **Status**: Successfully completed
- **Duration**: ~15 minutes
- **Cost**: $200

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Precedent Accuracy**: ✅ PASS (100%) - Correctly identified that precedent exists
- **Outcome Completeness**: ✅ PASS - Provided detailed efficacy and safety outcomes
- **NCT ID Recall**: ❌ FAIL (0%) - Did not identify specific NCT trial IDs
- **Enhanced Recall** (with product names): ❌ FAIL (33.3%) - Found mRNA-4157 but missed other trials

### Key Findings from Kosmos:
1. **mRNA-4157 (V940)** by Moderna/Merck - Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942 trial in melanoma
   - Improved recurrence-free survival (HR 0.56)
   - 18-month RFS: 79% vs 62% with pembrolizumab alone

2. **Autogene cevumeran (BNT122)** by BioNTech/Genentech - Phase I trial in pancreatic cancer
   - 50% of patients mounted robust T-cell responses
   - Vaccine responders had longer recurrence-free survival

### Files Generated:
1. `/Users/ai/Documents/code/kosmos/output/task2_results/kosmos_raw_output.json` - Full Kosmos response
2. `/Users/ai/Documents/code/kosmos/output/task2_results/metrics.json` - Evaluation metrics
3. `/Users/ai/Documents/code/kosmos/output/task2_results/task2_report.md` - Complete experiment report
4. `/Users/ai/Documents/code/kosmos/input/task2_ground_truth.json` - Ground truth data

### Overall Assessment: FAIL
While Kosmos correctly identified that mRNA neoantigen vaccines exist and provided detailed clinical outcomes, it failed to identify the majority of known trials, achieving only 33.3% recall when counting product name matches.

### Issues Fixed:
- Discovered that the Edison API returns "success" status instead of "completed"
- Fixed the monitoring script to handle this status correctly
- Enhanced evaluation to recognize product names and trial names, not just NCT IDs

The task has been completed successfully with all required artifacts generated and evaluated!
