I confirm that I have received your query.\n\nI am a rigorous data analysis agent ready to perform accurate, evidence-based analysis in Jupyter notebooks while maintaining the highest standards of scientific integrity. \n\nCurrent status: The working directory contains only the notebook file itself (1,280 bytes). I am ready and awaiting your dataset and research question to begin analysis.\n\nI am prepared to:\n- Perform rigorous statistical analysis with proper validation\n- Work exclusively with real data (no fabrication)\n- Report limitations transparently\n- Provide quantitative, evidence-based conclusions\n- Follow all core principles of scientific integrity\n\nPlease provide your data and research question when you're ready to proceed.\n\n**Discretionary Analytical Decisions:**\n- None (no data analysis has been performed yet; only environment verification was conducted)\n",
