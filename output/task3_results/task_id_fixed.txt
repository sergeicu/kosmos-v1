The dataset includes expression counts for 500 genes across 5 samples.
Key observations:
- Some genes show dramatic upregulation in heat shock conditions
- Known heat shock genes like dnaK, dnaJ, groEL, groES are included

Please perform the following analysis:
1. Identify differentially expressed genes between control and heat shock conditions
2. Perform pathway enrichment analysis
3. Generate 2-3 testable hypotheses about the heat shock response mechanism
4. Create publication-quality visualizations (heatmap, volcano plot, pathway diagram)

Instructions:
- Use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., DESeq2, edgeR methodology)
- Apply multiple testing correction (e.g., Benjamini-Hochberg FDR)
- Consider genes with |log2FC| > 1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 as significant
- Focus on chaperone proteins, proteases, and transcription factors
- Generate clear, testable hypotheses based on the differential expression patterns

Please create a comprehensive Jupyter notebook with:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Differential expression analysis
- Pathway enrichment
- Visualization generation
- Hypothesis formulation

Export the results including:
- List of significant DEGs with fold changes and p-values
- Enriched pathways with enrichment scores
- Generated figures
- Testable hypotheses with rationale
